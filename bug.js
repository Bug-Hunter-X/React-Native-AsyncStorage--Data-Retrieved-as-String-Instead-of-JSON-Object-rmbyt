In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, an uncommon error might occur where the data is retrieved as a string instead of the expected JSON object. This typically happens when the data is initially stored as a JSON object using `JSON.stringify` but isn't parsed correctly during retrieval.  The resulting string cannot be directly used as a JSON object, causing unexpected behavior or crashes.  This could be masked if you are only checking for null values, and not actually parsing the retrieved value. For example, trying to access a nested object property from the string representation will likely result in a runtime error. 

```javascript
// Incorrect retrieval
const retrievedData = await AsyncStorage.getItem('myData');
console.log(retrievedData.someProperty); // Error!  retrievedData is a string.
```
